BloomJS
====

A javascript search engine.

## Basic idea
I have a static weblog, generated thanks to [Blogit](https://github.com/phyks/blogit, caution this code is ugly) and, as I only want to have html files on my server, I needed to find a way to enable users to search my blog.

An index is generated by a Python script, upon generation of the pages, and is dynamically downloaded by the client when he wants to search for contents.

## Files

* `generate_index.py` : Python script to generate the index (runs only at page generation) in a nice format for Javascript
* `samples/` : samples for testing purpose (taken from my blog articles)

## Notes
I got the idea while reading [this page](http://www.stavros.io/posts/bloom-filter-search-engine/?print) found on [Sebsauvage's shaarli](http://sebsauvage.net/links/). I searched a bit for code doing what I wanted and found these ones :

* https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js
* https://github.com/reyesr/fullproof

But I wasn't fully satisfied by the first one, and I found the second one too heavy and complicated for my purpose, so I ended up coding this.
